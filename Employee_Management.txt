Project Title
Employee Management System using Python, Tkinter and MySQL

1. Introduction
In many organizations, employee information is still maintained manually using paper or basic files, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
The purpose of this project is to develop a GUI-based Employee Management System that allows users to manage employee records efficiently.
This system will be developed using the Python programming language. Tkinter will be used to design the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and MySQL will be used as the database to store employee information securely.

2. Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To develop a user-friendly employee management application
To store employee records in a structured database
To reduce manual work and paperwork
To allow easy addition, update, and deletion of employee records
To enable fast searching of employee information
To ensure data accuracy and security


3. Features of the System
The system will provide the following features:

Employee ID input
Employee Name input
Designation input
Salary input
Gender selection
Address input
Search employee by ID or Name
Add new employee record
Update existing employee information
Delete employee record
Clear input fields
Display all employee records
Table view for showing employee data


4. Scope of the Project
This system can be used in:

Small and medium-sized organizations
Educational institutions
Offices and companies
Human Resource (HR) departments
The project is mainly intended for educational purposes and small-scale employee management.
